# Project #

This project will do the following
- a city to be moving oposit directions like godzilla is walking
- somethin poping up at a certain time from the back ground
- it runs in a loop
- people move on mouse over
- dark grey clouds moving in the background
- clouds moving same direction as godzilla
- road, gozilla ontop

## MUST HAVES
    use of a conditional statement, and
    use of a loop, and
    use of a function that you write and call in the code.

What you draw is up to you, but feel free to use these ideas as inspiration:

    A city skyline that features some sort of movement â€“  clouds in the sky, cars on the street, etc.
    An animation featuring a rising sun and a following sunset.
    Abstract art that uses random numbers and loops to determine the placement and size of shapes and objects.
